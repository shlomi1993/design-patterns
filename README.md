# Design Patterns

In this repository I implemented every Design Pattern I've learned in Advanced Programming 1 course at Bar-Ilan University.

After learning at Introto Computer Science course the basics of the profession and memory structures using the C language, and we learned in  Object-Oriented Programming course the principles of Object-Oriented Programming using the Java language, in this course we learned important principles in advanced programming, with an emphasis on Design Patterns.

In the Advanced Programming course 1, we've learned:
* Template functions / Object functions
* STL and Algorihtms
* Basics of Client-Server with C ++
* Object Oriented Analysis
* Object Oriented Design
* And more ...

A very central subject in the course is Design Patterns, and because it is so important, I decided to program all the Design Patterns we've learned as part of the course. And share it with you guyd.

I programmed in C++ using VS Code.
I also attached a document of the Design Patterns UMLs, according to https://refactoring.guru/ website, to Dr. Eli Khalasche's lectures and to Wikipedia.org.
